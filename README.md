Grade Point Average Calculator
The single grade calculator you wrote during Tech Check 3 was a big hit with your client! We now have a well-running console program to translate single letter Grades (e.g. “B+”) into numeric, grade point style grades (e.g. 3.3). This code can be viewed in the attached tc4_before_PROVIDED.py file. 
Your client is now pleased with how the program is working, but would like some additions made to it. Students would like to enter final letter grades for their six courses for the term (PROG1700, NETW1700, OSYS1200, WEBD1000, COMM1700, & DBAS1001) and to not only see the grade for that individual course reported, but also to see a final grade point average.
Reminder of rules/requirements of the conversion of a letter grade to a grade:
•	Possible letter grades are A, B, C, D, and F with numeric values of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively
•	Possible modifiers are a plus (+), a minus (–) or nothing.  

Remember our mantra that “duplication is a killer for IT”. Instead of copying the important blocks of code to perform the letter-to-numeric grade conversion six times, it should be reworked into a function that we can simply call six times.
